This project aims to be a hosting for my rationale for the new types of fibers. See this [wiki page](https://github.com/victor-smirnov/green-fibers/wiki/Dialectics-of-fibers-and-coroutines-in-Cxx-and-successor-languages) for detais.

To build the benchnarks plese see into the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/victor-smirnov/green-fibers/blob/main/docker/Dockerfile) for environment configuration. Tests may be run from inside the Docker container: `docker run -it <image_id> /bin/bash`.
